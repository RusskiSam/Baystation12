changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added a system to invest spell slots to get more back. You can invest one spellslot at a time and you will recieve two back. Sacrificing specific items/reagents onto the spellbook will shorten the time by ten minutes. Can be done once per investment."
  - tweak: "Shapeshifting damage share now spreads out the damage to roughly ten damage chunks. Makes it less of a limb-gibber."
  - tweak: "Baleful Polymorph buffs the shapeshiftee's health pool to fifty, so no longer can you get insta-killed."
  - tweak: "Avian Form has been renamed to Polymorph (get it?)"
  - tweak: "Polymorph no longer strips you when you transform."
  - tweak: "Polymorph and Baleful Polymorph no longer share damage."
  - tweak: "Armalis icons are properly centered, for real this time."
