changes: 
  - bugfix: "Fixes disarm-attack dislocation chances being so low that you were very likely to break the targeted limb before it would dislocate."
  - bugfix: "It is now possible to disarm-attack with stunbatons like with other melee weapons. Note that this means that using a stunbaton on disarm intent will hurt people."
